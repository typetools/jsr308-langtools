;;; Changing receiver annotation syntax for JSR 308
;;;

;; This is Emacs code that converts from old-style (C++-style) receiver
;; annotations, such as:
;;   class MyClass {
;;     void myMethod() /*@ReceiverAnno*/ { ... }
;;     void myMethod2(int x, bool y) /*@ReceiverAnno*/ { ... }
;;   }
;; to new-style receiver annotations on a formal parameter named "this", such as 
;;   class MyClass {
;;     void myMethod(@ReceiverAnno Myclass this) { ... }
;;     void myMethod2(@ReceiverAnno MyClass this, int x, bool y) { ... }
;;   }
;; It is not 100% automated, nor does it convert all code perfectly, but it
;; greatly reduces manual effort.
;; A Python script that performs this same action is also available.


;; Start off with this as a compilation (not a grep!) command:
;;   search -i -n '[^"]\) (/\*)?@' | grep -v '\.jaif:'
;; (The search program is http://plume-lib.googlecode.com/hg/bin/search, or
;; you can use find and grep instead.)

;; Then create a macro that does
;;   C-x `           (next-error)
;;   M-x change-receiver-annotation-1 RET
;; and apply it repeatedly.

;; Which buffer is being operated on gets confused if (next-error) is
;; within this.
