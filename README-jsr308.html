<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
(If you are impatient, you can skip to the
<a href="#installing">installation instructions</a>.)
</p>

<!-- TODO: link for langtools once there's a definitive place to link to -->
<p>The JSR 308 &ldquo;prototype implementation&rdquo; (also called the
&ldquo;reference implementation&rdquo;) is a version of
the OpenJDK Java 7 &ldquo;langtools&rdquo; that have been updated to
support <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/">JSR 308</a>.
JSR 308
is a backward-compatible extension of the Java language that
permits annotations to appear on types.
</p>

<p>
You may use the JSR 308 implementation as a replacement for the
OpenJDK or any other Java implementation.
In particular, you may use the JSR 308 <code>javac</code> compiler as a drop-in
replacement for the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/">OpenJDK <code>javac</code> compiler</a> or any
other compiler for the Java 7 language.
<!--
, and you may use the JSR 308 <code>javap</code> tool
serves as a drop-in replacement for the OpenJDK <code>javap</code> tool,
and it can optionally disassemble both <a
href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175">JSR 175</a> and JSR 308
annotations.
-->
</p>

<p>
JSR 308 makes it possible to create compiler plug-ins that check
user-defined type qualifiers.  The <a
href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/current/checkers-manual.html">Checkers
Framework</a> makes such plug-ins easy to create, and it includes several
example type qualifiers that you can start using right away.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="#installing">&ldquo;Installing the JSR 308
compiler&rdquo;</a> section below contains
instructions for installing, running, and testing the compiler.
</p>

<p>
IDEs such as Eclipse have not yet been updated to support JSR 308.  To use
the JSR 308 compiler with Eclipse, write an <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> buildfile that compiles your project
(using the JSR 308 compiler), then build by running Ant.  Problem markers
will show up in the Eclipse IDE as normal.  (You will lose a few Eclipse
features, such as error checking as you type, until Eclipse's internal
compiler is updated for JSR 308.)
</p>


<h2 id="features">Features of the JSR 308 prototype implementation</h2>

<p>
The JSR 308 prototype implementation is a Java compiler that supports the
JSR 308 specification
(<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.pdf">PDF</a>,
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html">HTML</a>),
which permits annotations to appear on any occurrence of a type.
</p>

<h3 id="typeprocessor">The <code>-typeprocessor</code> <code>javac</code> command-line option</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> In versions of the JSR 308 compiler 0.4 and following, the
<code>-typeprocessor</code> option is no longer needed. It has been retained in
0.4 for backward compatibility, but it will be removed in a future release. For
versions 0.4 and following, the <code>-processor</code> option may be used for
all annotation processors, including type-checking plug-ins.</p>

<p>The JSR 308 compiler adds the <code>-typeprocessor</code>
command-line option for running annotation processors.
The <code>-typeprocessor</code> option is semantically
similar to the standard <code>-processor</code> option:  either option is
followed by a list of the (fully-qualified) class names of the annotation
processors to run.  An example (using the
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/current/checkers-manual.html#nullness-checker">Nullness checker</a>) is:
</p>
<pre><code>  javac -typeprocessor checkers.nonnull.NonnullChecker MyFile.java
</code></pre>

<p>
Annotation processors specified using the <code>-typeprocessor</code>
option are invoked after the compiler's attribution phase (also known as
type resolution), giving the processor access to completed symbols.  By
contrast, processors specified using the <code>-processor</code> option are
invoked before the compiler's attribution phase.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In the prototype implementation prior to version 0.4, the
<code>-typeprocessor</code> and <code>-processor</code>
options are mutually exclusive and should not be used
simultaneously.</p>


<h3 id="annotations-in-comment">Writing annotations in comments for backward compatibility</h3>

<p>
The prototype implementation of the JSR 308 compiler allows annotations to
be written in &ldquo;<code>/* */</code>&ldquo; (C-style) comments, for example:
</p>
<pre>
  List&lt;/*@NonNull*/ String&gt; strings;
</pre>
<p>
There must be no whitespace
between the comment delimiters and the annotation name.
</p>

<p>
This mechanism allows developers to use JSR 308
annotations while maintaining the ability to compile their code with an
unmodified Java compiler, including compilers for earlier versions of the
Java language (such as Java 4, Java 5, or Java 6).
</p>
 
<p>
This temporary mechanism will not be part of the official Java language
when JSR 308 is incorporated into it.  It may or may not continue to be
supported by the javac compiler.
</p>

<!--
javac support for the comment syntax may help to transition users gently to
the new Java 7 features.  Java programmers delayed adopting Java 5 (e.g.,
generics), primarily because of backward compatibility issues:  e.g., their
coworkers/boss/customers didn't want to use Java 5.  But if we could give
programmers the benefits of type annotations while not affecting backward
compatibility, that might help more people adopt Java 7 sooner, thus
increasing its momentum.
-->


<p>
The JSR 308 compiler does not (yet) read import statements that appear in
comments, such as
</p>
<pre>
/*import checkers.quals.*;*/
</pre>
<p>
Because any import statement must appear uncommented, you may need to
include one or more qualifier definitions (<code>@interface</code>
declarations) on your classpath when compiling your code using a Java 4/5/6
compiler.
</p>


<h3 id="javap-annotations">The <code>-annotations</code> <code>javap</code> command-line option</h3>

<p>The JSR 308 <code>javap</code> tool adds the <code>-annotations</code>
command-line option for displaying the properties of both JSR 175 and JSR 308
annotations. The OpenJDK <code>javap</code> tool normally displays annotations
as raw hexadecimal strings; the modified tool parses annotations and
displays their names, arguments, and other properties (including the internal
fields of JSR 308 annotations as specified in <a
href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html#htoc10">Section
4 of the JSR 308 proposal</a>).
</p>

<p>Since annotation attributes are typically only displayed in conjunction
with the <code>-verbose</code> command-line option, the
<code>-annotations</code> option does nothing without the
<code>-verbose</code> option.
</p>


<h3 id="proposal">Differences from the JSR 308 proposal</h3>

<p>The JSR 308 prototype compiler implementation differs from the design
specified in the <a
href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html">JSR 308
proposal</a> in the following ways, which will be corrected in the future:
</p>
<ul>
  <!-- As of 07/04/2008 -->
  <li>support for annotations on primitive class literals (e.g.
  <tt>@Foo int.class</tt>) is limited to the parser and the AST
  (i.e. annotations are not compiled into class files)</li>
  <li>
    <!-- As of 6/24/2008. -->
    The <tt>ElementType.TYPE_USE</tt> enum element does not yet exist
    (including this change in our distribution would be a bit tricky, as <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/ElementType.html">ElementType</a>
    is not part of the compilers <tt>langtools</tt> source code base).
    The compiler does not yet enforce the <tt>@Target</tt> meta-annotation on
    the new annotation locations.
    You can work around this by omitting the <tt>@Target</tt> annotation.
    Then, your annotation will be permitted to appear anywhere.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>


<h2 id="installing">Installing the JSR 308 compiler (&ldquo;langtools&rdquo;)</h2>

<p>
Use the following instructions to install the JSR 308 compiler.
</p>

<p>
Note that while these instructions install the JSR 308 compiler, you do not
have to make the JSR 308 compiler your default compiler.  For example, you
could use the JSR 308 compiler only for running pluggable type-checkers.
Also, you can use javac's <tt>-target</tt> argument to generate bytecodes
that are compatible with earlier JVMs, so that you can work seamlessly with
colleagues who are using an earlier version of Java.
</p>

<p>
If you use an Apple <b>Macintosh (Mac OS X)</b> computer, you must <a href="#building">build
the compiler from source</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="installing-short">The short instructions (for Linux only)</h3>

<!--
 This text is identically reproduced at ../checkers/manual/introduction.tex
 so if you change either one, change the other also!
-->

<p>
The following commands install
the JSR 308 <tt>javac</tt> compiler and the Checker
Framework, or update an existing installation.
It currently works only on <b>Linux</b>.
For more details, or if anything goes wrong, see the comments in the 
<tt>Makefile-jsr308-install</tt> file.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  Execute the following commands:
<pre>
  cd
  wget -nv -N http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/current/Makefile-jsr308-install
  make -f Makefile-jsr308-install
</pre>

</li>
<li>
Set some environment variables according to the instructions at the top of file
<tt>~/Makefile-jsr308-install</tt>.
</li>

</ol>



<h3 id="installing-long">The longer instructions</h3>


<p>
<b>Requirements:</b> These instructions assume that <a
href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> is installed.
If you use an Apple <b>Macintosh</b> computer, you must <a href="#building">build
the compiler from source</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Install a new copy of OpenJDK.  This new installation will be modified
    later (but no other copy of OpenJDK will be modified).  You can
    put the new installation anywhere you want; a common place is in a new
    directory <code>~/jsr308</code>.  We will call that directory
    <tt>$JSR308</tt>.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
	Download a JDK 7 <a
	href="http://download.java.net/jdk7/binaries/">binary snapshot:
	self-extracting JDK file</a>
	(choose JDK, not JRE or DEBUG, and choose a binary, not a source
	distribution).
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the installation instructions &mdash; essentially,
	just run the <code>.exe</code>, <code>.sh</code>, or <code>.bin</code>
	file that you downloaded and follow the directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally set the default version of Java.  (At any time, you can run either the
        default or the non-default version of Java.)
      	<ul>
	  <li>
	For <b>Linux</b>:  
	After installing, your old version of Java remains the default.
        If you wish to make OpenJDK Java 7 the default, then
	set your <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to the top-level
	directory of the JDK 7 installation <code>/path/to/jdk1.7.0</code>, and
	augment your <code>PATH</code> with
	<code>/path/to/jdk1.7.0/bin</code>.  Example:
<pre>
export JSR308=$HOME/jsr308
export JAVA_HOME=$JSR308/jdk1.7.0
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
</pre>
	The shell uses the <code>PATH</code> variable to locate <code>java</code>,
	while Ant uses <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
        For <b>Windows</b>:
	After installing, the OpenJDK Java 7 (at <code>c:\Program
	Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\</code>) becomes the default.
	If you wish to retain an older version of Java as the default, then
	do the following:
          <ol>
	    <li>Install Java 7</li>
	    <li>Copy the <tt>jdk1.7.0</tt> and <tt>jre1.7.0</tt> directories from <tt>Program Files\Java\</tt> to the desktop</li>
            <li>Uninstall Java 7</li>
	    <li>Move the <tt>jdk/jre</tt> directories back to <tt>Program Files\Java\</tt></li>
          </ol>
        If you want to be able to run javac from Cygwin, then set
	environment variables as for Linux, above.
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Verify that your installation is correct: run
	<code>javac -version</code>, and the output should be <code>javac
	1.7.0-ea</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>


  </li>
  <li>
    Download the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/#Download">JSR
    308 prototype implementation</a>, and unpack it to create a
    <code>langtools</code> directory.  Do <em>not</em> do this inside the
    JDK 7 installation (directory <code>jdk1.7.0</code>) that you
    downloaded in the preceding step.
    Example commands:
<pre>
cd ~/jsr308
wget http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/jsr308/current/jsr308-langtools.zip
unzip jsr308-langtools.zip
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable points to the
    JDK you wish to patch, then patch your JDK 7 installation by running:
<pre>cd langtools/binary
ant install</pre>
    This step makes a backup copy of <tt>tools.jar</tt> and then
    modifies the original by copying some new <tt>.class</tt> files into it.

    <p>(You shouldn't need to undo this step, but you
    can do so by running <tt>ant uninstall</tt>
    which puts back the original version of the <tt>tools.jar</tt> file.)
    </p>

    <!-- This is only applicable to Windows users. -->
    <p>If you get this error message:</p>
    <!-- This is a made-up error message; this document needs to be updated. -->
<pre>
  c:\jsr308\langtools\binary\build.xml:29: Unable to rename old file (c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\lib\tools.jar.patched) to new file (c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\lib\tools.jar)
</pre>
    <p>
    then rename the file manually using the shell.
    (This error occurs under Windows when some other process, such as an anti-virus
    program or another Java process, is accessing the given file.)
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    Run
<pre>
javac -version
</pre>
    and confirm that the output contains the
    string <code>jsr308</code>, such as <code>javac 1.7.0-jsr308-0.6.2</code>.
    <br />
    If the output is does not contain <code>jsr308</code> 
    (e.g., <code>javac 1.7.0-ea</code>), but you are using the
    correct <code>javac</code> binary (in <code>langtools/dist/bin</code>), 
    then it is possible that
    <code>tools.jar</code> is on your classpath.  You should either remove
    <code>tools.jar</code> from your classpath, or else put 
    <code>langtools/dist/lib/javac.jar</code> and/or 
    <code>langtools/dist/lib/javap.jar</code>
    on your classpath before <code>tools.jar</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
When updating to a newer version of the JSR 308 compiler, you only have to
follow steps 2, 3, and 4.  In other words, you only have to redo step 1 if
you want a newer version of OpenJDK.
</p>


<h3 id="building">Building the JSR 308 compiler from source</h3>

<p>
To build the JSR 308 compiler from source, replace <a href="#installing-long">step 3 from above</a> by
the following.  Building from source is useful mainly for people who are
developing compiler plug-ins or modifying the compiler itself.  If you only
want to <em>use</em> the compiler and plug-ins, it is sufficient to install
the pre-compiled version.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirements:</b> These instructions assume that
<!-- Need a version of Ant that supports the nested "condition" element
  inside a <fail> directive.   Version 1.6 (Feb 2004) does not work. -->
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> (version 1.7 or later)
and
JDK 6 are installed.  You will use JDK 6 to compile OpenJDK, but will not use it
thereafter.  You can get JDK 6 from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun</a> or
elsewhere.  If you use an Apple Macintosh (Mac OS X), then depending on
your hardware and operating system, you can either use <a
href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">Apple's implementation</a> or <a
href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">SoyLatte</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a file <code>~/.openjdk/build.properties</code>
    containing the following text, but replace
    <code>/path/to/java/jdk</code> by
    the location of your JDK 6 installation.
<pre>
boot.java.home = <b>/path/to/java/jdk</b>
target.java.home = ${boot.java.home}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Compile the JSR 308 javac compiler and the javap tool, from
    directory <code>langtools/make</code>:
<pre>cd langtools/make
ant clean build-javac build-javap</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the <code>langtools/dist/bin</code> directory to the front of your
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The effect of the above commands is that the <code>javac</code>
command invokes the JSR 308 Java compiler and the <code>javap</code>
command invokes the JSR 308 <code>javap</code>, but the Java 7 OpenJDK
is used for everything else.
</p>


<h2 id="differences">Differences from the OpenJDK distribution</h2>

<p>The JSR 308 distribution includes only the <code>langtools</code>
portion of the OpenJDK distribution. The JSR 308 prototype implementation
makes no modifications in other parts of the OpenJDK distribution, and the
remaining parts of the distribution are not necessary to build and use the
JSR 308 tools.
</p>

<p>This JSR 308 distribution differs from the <code>langtools</code>
portion of Sun's OpenJDK distribution
in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The compiler source code (which is located in
    <code>langtools/src/share/classes</code>) supports the JSR 308; it
    permits annotations to appear on any occurrence of a type.</li>
  <li>The
    <a href="#typeprocessor"><code>-typeprocessor</code>
    command-line option</a>, which runs an annotation processor
    after types have been resolved, has been added to the compiler.</li>
  <li>
    In addition to ordinary JSR 175 annotations, the compiler parses JSR
    308 annotations, and also any annotation written in <a
    href="#annotations-in-comment">specifically-formatted comments for
    backward compatibility</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Six <code>javac</code> test cases are skipped by
    the test runner due to failures caused by JSR 308
    modifications.  We will correct these failures and re-enable the test cases in a future release.<br />
    If you run the test suite, you will find that some of its test cases 
    fail.  These tests also fail for the OpenJDK compiler.  The JSR 308
    changes do not introduce any new test failures (except in test cases
    that are skipped).</li>
  <li>
    The <code>javap</code> tool has been modified to display the properties of
    both JSR 175 and JSR 308 annotations via the <a
    href="#javap-annotations"><code>-annotations</code> command-line
    option</a>.
  </li>
  <li>This documentation file has been included.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, your <code>javac</code> will not properly pass
<code>-J&lt;flag&gt;</code> flags to the runtime system.  This is a problem
with the OpenJDK system, not with the JSR 308 changes.  If you wish to
adjust the arguments to the runtime system (i.e., <code>java</code>), then
you will need to edit
<code>langtools/dist/bin/javac</code>.
</p>


<h3 id="diffs">Determining a diff against the OpenJDK distribution</h3>

<p>The JSR 308 distribution is a modification of the 
<code>langtools</code> portion of Sun's
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>
<code>javac</code> distribution.  The version of OpenJDK on which the
JSR 308 distribution is based is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- version -->35 (11 Sept 2008)<!-- /version -->
</blockquote>

<p>The following commands determine the differences between the JSR
308 compiler and the OpenJDK compiler.
The shell variable <code>$VENDOR</code> refers
to the location of the unmodified source code and
<code>$JSR308</code> refers to the location of the
extracted JSR 308 compiler distribution.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you do not have a checkout of the OpenJDK
  compiler, obtain one:

  <pre><code>
  export VENDOR=vendor-langtools
  hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7/langtools $VENDOR
  cd $VENDOR; hg up jdk7-b<!-- revision -->35<!-- /revision -->
  </code></pre>

  <p>If you already have a checkout of the OpenJDK compiler, ensure
  that it is at the same revision as the modifications,
  using the following command in the $VENDOR directory:
  </p>

  <pre><code>
  hg pull; hg up jdk7-b<!-- revision -->35<!-- /revision -->
  </code></pre>

  </li>
  <li>Use one of these <code>diff</code> commands to generate the
  differences.  The second shows the contents of new files,
  whereas the first only reports that the new file exists.

  <pre><code>
  diff -ur -x .hg -x dist -x build $VENDOR/src $JSR308/j2se/src
  diff -urN -x .hg -x dist -x build $VENDOR/src $JSR308/j2se/src
  </code></pre>
</ol>

  <li>Any problem that occurs with the JSR 308 compiler but does not occur
      with the OpenJDK Java 7 compiler on which the JSR 308 compiler is built.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The JSR 308 compiler is built on Sun's OpenJDK compiler.  If you find a bug
in the JSR 308 compiler, it might be due to a bug in the OpenJDK compiler
(in which case it should be reported to Sun), or it might be due to the JSR
308 modifications (in which case it should be reported to the JSR 308
compiler implementers).  In some cases (such as a problem with processing
annotations on types), the responsibility is clearly with the JSR 308
modifications.  Otherwise, please determine who is responsible for the bug
using this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain a copy of Mercurial reversion <!-- revision -->35<!-- /revision --> of
  the OpenJDK compiler, using the commands in the <a href="#diffs">diff
  section</a> of this document.</li>
  <li>Try your test case using the
  OpenJDK compiler.  If the problem is present, then search the
  <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">bug database</a> (use
  the &ldquo;Java&rdquo; category).  If the problem is not in the bug database, then
  <a href="http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/index.jsp">report your
  bug to Sun</a>, using category &ldquo;Java&rdquo;
  and subcategory &ldquo;compiler&rdquo;.
  </li>
</ol>



<p>
If the problem is present in the JSR 308 compiler, but not in the OpenJDK
compiler, then please report it to us.  Send your bug report to
<!-- should we use the main JSR 308 mailing list instead?? -->
<a
href="mailto:jsr308-bugs@lists.csail.mit.edu">jsr308-bugs@lists.csail.mit.edu</a>.
This is not a mailing list for general support or questions.
</p>

<p>
Please ensure that your bug report is clear and that it is complete.
Otherwise, we may be unable to understand it or to reproduce it, either of
which would prevent us from fixing the bug.  Sun has a description of
<a
href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/bugreport_howto/index.html">how
to write a helpful bug report</a>.  Here are some crucial points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indicate exactly what you did.  Show the exact commands (don't merely
      describe them in words).  Don't skip any steps.
  </li>
  <li>Include all files that are necessary to reproduce the problem.  This
      includes every file that is used by any of the commands you reported, and
      possibly other files as well.
  </li>
  <li>Indicate exactly what the result was (don't merely describe it in
      words).
      Also indicate what you expected the result to be &mdash; remember,
      a bug is a difference between desired and actual outcomes.
  </li>
  <li>Indicate which version of the JSR 308 compiler you are using.
      You can determine that by running <code>javac -version</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
